TQ Non-transitive die  R > W > G > R
RED die = 3 3 3 3 3 6
GREEN die = 1 4 4 4 4 4
WHITE die = 2 2 2 5 5 5 

Make the die.
Do battle --take data
R vs. W  

GET DATA WITH CLICKER

The data seems to show that R  beats W more often than not, let's compute the exact probability.

1) For R and W die make the prob table
2) Make a prob. table for the product sample space of R and W
3) What is the probability that R beats W?

TIMED 
We'll give complete answer

We saw R > W. We'll tell you that W > G
CQ Does R > G?

FOR HW  you may be surprised.
