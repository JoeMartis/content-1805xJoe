    Mention: we're pioneering this, exciting, but we'll be technical problems
write to me if you encounter them.

Quickly through intro  **don't mention Bayesian and frequentist  **USE BOARD
   Prob and statistics are two different subjects 
   with deep connections
      Both are about random processes

   Prob
      logically self contained: 
      Start with known probabilities and compute other probabilities
      Follow a few rules and though computation can be tricky
       the answers follow logically.
     Example: For a coin known to be fair (prob of heads = prob of tails = 1/2)
     what is the probability of getting 60 or more heads in 100 tosses.
     This has one correct answer.

    Statistics 
       messier and more of an art. 
       Get experimental data try to draw probabilistic conclusions
    E.g. Start with a coin of unknown origin
    Flip it 100 times, say you get 60 heads. (This is DATA)
    What can you conclude about fairness of the coin
    More generally about its prob. of getting heads
    There is no one correct answer to this question.
    How you approach the problem and the conclusions you draw depend
    your needs and the choices you make.

List applications: medicine, genetics, biology, psychology, physical sciences,
epidemiology, climate modeling, gambling, etc.
Any subject that deals with data.

Mention toy models
  Get at essence of messier real examples
  E.g. success or failure of airplane, medical treatment, student in a class
  can be abstracted to heads or tails on tossing an unfair coin. 

  We will look at both real and toy models in this class. 
  The beauty is how well simplified models often capture the important
  features of messy system

-------------
COUNTING
Start with motivating questions to see why counting is important

Example 1    **as TQ:  5 minutes                   ***SLIDE
1 head in 3 flips
**TAspush stuck groups to list and count

Point out counting and difficulty with, say 10 flips

Example 2    **as immediate CQ          ***slide
Probability of pair in poker
POINT: need to count

-------------
Sets  in words                   **slide of all 12 months 
On Board
S = everything
Intersection: AND  L cap R = everything in both L and R       
Union: OR          L cup R = everything in L or in R (or both)
Complement: NOT    L^c = everything not in L (also S-L)
                   L-R = everything in L not in R  

Venn visualization               **slide of venn
If this is unfamiliar see us in office hours

DeMorgan                         **SHORT SLIDE
DeMorgans shows relation between union intersection and complement
Example:  L = left-handed, R=red-haired
You're in L cap R means your a left-handed red-head
Left side says not a left-h red-head, right side -not left-h or not red (or both)

-----------------
Product of sets              

Define S x T = {(s,t)}   **SLIDE   do examples on board

{1,2,3} x {1,2,3,4}, as table
[1,4] x [2,3],       as rectangle

COUNTING
Inclusion-exclusion principle   **SLIDE venn diagram

example 5                   **SLIDE Table question
Band of singers and guitar players (7 sing, 4 play guitar, 2 do both)
Give the answer 9: skip solution.  
Point out it's explained in the reading

-------------------
RULE OF PRODUCT              **Slide
State 
If n ways to do action 1 followed by m ways to do action 2
then there are nxm ways to do 1 followed by 2

3 shirts, 4 pants = 3x4=12 outfits

example 7                    **TQ  SLIDE
5 Competitors in 100m final. 
How many ways can gold silver and bronze be awarded
Give solution 

NOTE the choice of the gold medalist affects who can get the silver.
but not number of possibilities

-------------------
Permuatations                 **SLIDE
Definition on board
A permutation of a set is a particular order of the set
{a, b, c} has six perm. Give list

Could count list using rule of product


Example 8: give problem        **SLIDE
List all permutations of 3 elements out of 4 things 
Think about how you'd do this
answer                          **slide
POINT these lists get long. 
We need to organize our thinking to count them

-------------
Combinations                  **SLIDE
In contrast to perm. for combinations order doesn't matter  

example                       **SLIDE
List all comb. of 3 things out of the set {a,b,c,d}
DO ON BOARD

Formulas and notations       **NO SLIDE
nPk, nCk = (nk) 
nPk =  n(n-1) ... (n-k+1) = n!/(n-k)!

ex. 5P3 = 5x4x3 = 5x4x3x2x1/2x1 = 5!/2!

Relate Perm and Comb          **SLIDE
nCk = nPk/k! reasoning each comb occurs k! times in set of perm.

example 11          **BQ
Count the number of ways to get exactly 3 heads in 10 flips of a coin
