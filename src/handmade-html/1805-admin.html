<h2>18.05: Basic Structure of the Course</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We will take an active learning approach similar in some respects to TEAL.</li>
  <li>You must do the reading and answer reading questions before each class.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In class we will assume you have done the reading. We will lecture on the material assuming this. </li>
    <li>We <i>do not</i> expect that you will have mastered the material on first reading. The goal is to start the process, so class will be more productive.</li>
    <li>The reading questions will prepare you for the harder questions we will work during class and on the problem sets. </li>
    <li>The reading questions will count toward your grade.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>We meet three times a week for 80 minutes.</li>
  <ul> 
    <li>Tuesday/Thursday will be a blend of lecture, concept questions and group problem solving.</li>
    <li>Friday will be a <i>"studio"</i> day. It will involve longer problems and the use of Matlab. You will need to bring your laptop on Fridays.
  </ul>
  <li>We will use 'clicker questions' in class. </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Participation on these questions will also count toward your grade.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Matlab</li>
  <ul>
    <li>We will make frequent use of Matlab for computation, simulation and visualization.</li>
    <li>We will teach you everything you need to know to use Matlab as a tool.</li>
    <li>You will not be expected to use Matlab to do any hardcore computer programming.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Groups</h2>
For in-class group work we will use groups of 3.
<ul>
  <li>At the end of week 2 we will form permanent groups and make seating assignments.</li>
  <li>You will be able to choose your own group.</li>
  <li>If you need to find a group or your group needs a third person let us know and we'll help.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Text</h2>
There will be no assigned text for the class. We will post the reading to this website.

<h2>Problem Sets and Exams</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Problem sets</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Problem sets will be due most weeks, usually on Monday.</li>
    <li>You will turn them in to the Math Academic Services Office in room 2-285.</li>
    <li>They must be turned in by 4:30 on the day they are due. <b>Late homeworks will not receive credit.</b></li>
    <li>Generally speaking you will be able to check your final
 numerical answer (for those problems that 
have them) on this website. This means you will
be graded on how you arrive at your answer.</li>
    <li>The graders have strict instructions not to accept work that is
excessively sloppy or difficult to read.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Your work should be formatted like any paper or book. That is,
it should be given in lines that are written left to right and go down the
page.</li>
      <li>You should work the problem out on scratch paper first 
and then put the final version in your homework.</li>
      <li>Problems should be presented in order, so the grader can find them
easily.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Exams</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li>There will be two in-class midterm exams and a comprehensive final exam.</li>
    <li>The midterms will be designed to take 1 hour, but you will have the
entire 80 minutes of class to finish.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Grading</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Reading questions and in-class clicker questions will count for 10% of your grade.</li>
  <li>Problem sets will count for 25% of your grade. In computing your pset average we will drop your lowest score.</li>
  <li>The midterm exams will each count for 15% of your grade.</li>
  <li>The final exam will count for 35% of your grade.</li>
</ul>
