<h2>Collaboration</h2>

MIT has a culture of teamwork. We encourage you to work with study partners.
<ul>
  <li>Collaboration on homework is encouraged.
  <li>You must write your solutions yourself, in your own words.</li>
  <li>You must list all collaborators and outside sources of information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Clicker Abuse</h2>
We do not anticipate having this come up, but, sadly,  
we have been made aware that there are cases where some students
use a clicker for an absent student. It should go without saying that this is a major violation of academic integrity. 
 If we become aware of it happening there will be serious consequences, including the loss of all clicker points for both parties.
<p>
Please see <a = href="http://web.mit.edu/academicintegrity/consequences.html">MIT Academic Integrity: Consequences</a>

<h2>Discussion Boards</h2>
Our MITx site will have discussion boards. These can be a great resource for helping each other understand the material and problem sets.  There are a few ground rules.
<ul>
  <li>The usual rules of netiquette apply. Please be nice to each other. </li>
  <li>You may not provide solutions to pset problems.</li>
  <li>You may help clarify what's being asked, shed light on a concept, or direct others to relevant material.
