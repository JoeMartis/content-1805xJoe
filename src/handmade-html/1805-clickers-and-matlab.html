<h2>Clickers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We will use the Turning Technologies clickers in class. If you already have one from physics or chemistry it will work here as well.</li>
  <li>If you need one you can get it at the MIT coop.</li>
  <li>To register your clicker go to <a href="http://tsgphysics.mit.edu/front/?page=studReg.php">register clicker</a>. Simply follow the directions.</li>
  <li>If you change clickers you can register the new one. We will download the latest registration information just before class each day.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Matlab</h2>
We will use Matlab in this class, so you will need to have it installed on your computer. This is available for free to all students from:
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/student-matlab/">Student Matlab.</a> 
You should download and install it now.
<p>
Don't worry if you are not familiar with Matlab, we will provide plenty
of tutorials and guidance in its use.
<p>
If you are so inclined you can use Octave which is the open source copy of Matlab.
