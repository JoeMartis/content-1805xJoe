\begin{edXproblem}{lec1Q2}{10}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Example "option" problem}

Where is the earth?

\edXabox{options='up','down' expect='down'}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Example "symbolic" problem}

What is Einstein's equation for the energy equivalent of a mass $m$?

\edXabox{type='symbolic' size='90' expect='m*c\textcaret2' }

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Example "numerical" problem}

Estimate the energy savings (in J/y) if all the people
($3\times 10^8$) in the U.~S. switched from U.~S. code to low flow
shower heads.

\edXinline{Energy saved = }\edXabox{expect="0.52" type="numerical" tolerance='0.02' inline='1' } %
\edXinline{~EJ/year}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Example "multiple choice" problem}

What color is a banana?

\edXabox{ type="multichoice" expect="Yellow" options="Red","Green","Yellow","Blue" }

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Example "string response" problem}

In what U.S. state is Detroit located?

\edXabox{ type="string" expect="Michigan" options="ci" }

An explanation of the answer can be provided by using the edXsolution
macro.  Click on "Show Answer" to see the solution.

\begin{edXsolution}
Detroit is near Canada, but it is actually in the United States.
\end{edXsolution}
        
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Example "custom response" problem}

This problem demonstrates the use of a custom python script used for
checking the answer.

\begin{edXscript}
def sumtest(expect,ans):
    (a1,a2) = map(float,eval(ans))
    return (a1+a2)==10
\end{edXscript}

Enter a python list of two numbers which sum to 10, eg [9,1]:

\edXabox{expect="[1,9]" type="custom" cfn="sumtest"}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Example image}

Include image by using the edXxml macro:

\catcode`_=11
\edXxml{<img src="http://web.mit.edu/jorloff/www/cube-tet/cube_tet.gif"/>}
\catcode`_=8

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Example show/hide explanation}

Extra explanations can be tucked away behind a "showhide" toggle flag:

\edXshowhide{sh1}{More explanation}{This is a hidden explanation.  It
can contain equations: $\alpha = \frac{2}{\sqrt{1+\gamma}}$ }

This is some text after the showhide example.

\end{edXproblem}
