This is a sample problem, which is worth 10 points.

Give the correct python {\tt type} for the following expressions.  Select {\tt noneType} if the expression is illegal.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt 3}   \edXabox{expect="int" options="noneType","int","float"}
\item {\tt 5.2} \edXabox{expect="float" options="noneType","int","float"}
\item {\tt 3/2} \edXabox{expect="int" options="noneType","int","float"}
\item {\tt 1+[]} \edXabox{expect="noneType" options="noneType","int","float"}
\end{itemize}
