\section{Example of custom response}  

This problem demonstrates a custom response which accepts a student
answer even if it is given with quotes.

\begin{edXscript}
def test_str(expect, ans):
  print expect, ans
  ans = ans.strip("'")
  ans = ans.strip('"')
  return expect == ans.lower()
\end{edXscript}
