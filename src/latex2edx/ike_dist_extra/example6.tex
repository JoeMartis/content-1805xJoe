\section{Example of problem with hint}  

This problem demonstrates a question with hints, based on using the
{\tt hintfn} method.

\begin{edXscript}
def test_str(expect, ans):
  print expect, ans
  ans = ans.strip("'")
  ans = ans.strip('"')
  return expect == ans.lower()

def hint_fn(answer_ids, student_answers, new_cmap, old_cmap):
  aid = answer_ids[0]
  ans = str(student_answers[aid]).lower()
  print 'hint_fn called, ans=', ans
  hint = ''
  if 'java' in ans:
     hint = 'that is only good for drinking'
  elif 'pascal' in ans:
     hint = 'that is a beatnick language'
  elif 'fortran' in ans:
     hint = 'those were the good days'
  elif 'clu' in ans:
     hint = 'you must be invariant'
  if hint:
    hint = "<font color='blue'>Hint: {0}</font>".format(hint)
    new_cmap.set_hint_and_mode(aid,hint,'always')
\end{edXscript}

What is the best programming language that exists today?   You may
enter your answer in upper or lower case, with or without quotes.
