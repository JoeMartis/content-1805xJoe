\begin{edXproblem}{c2-rq1}{weight=5  showanswer='attempted' display_name="Class 2 Reading Questions" }

\problem1
Which of the following represents a valid probability table 

\begin{tabular}{ll|lllllll}
i) & outcomes & 1 &2 &3 &4 &5 \\
\cline{2-7}
&probability &1/5 &1/5 &1/5 &1/5 &1/5
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{ll|lllllll}
ii) & outcomes & 1 &2 &3 &4 &5 \\
\cline{2-7}
&probability &1/2 &1/5 &1/10 &1/10 &1/10
\end{tabular}

\edXabox{type="multichoice" expect="i and ii" options="i","ii","i and ii","not enough information" }

\problem2
A sample space has exactly two outcomes. The first has probability $p$
and the second has probability $3p$. What is the value of $p$?

\edXabox{expect=".25" type="numerical" tolerance='0.0001'}

\problem3
Let $A$ and $B$ be two events with $P(A) = 0.4$, $P(B) = 0.5$ and 
$P(A\cap B) = 0.3$. What is $P(A \cup B)$?
(Hint: visualize with Venn diagrams.)

\edXabox{type="multichoice" expect="0.6" options="0.5","0.6","0.7","0.8","0.9" }

\problem4
Our experiment consists of tossing a coin 3 times. Take the sample space
to be all sequences of 3 heads or tails.
\[ \Omega = \{HHH,\,HHT,\,HTH,\,HTT,\,THH,\,THT,\,TTH,\,TTT\}
\]
For each of the following give the size of the event.

i) The event 'there are more heads than tails'.

\edXabox{type="multichoice" expect="4" options="0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8"}

ii) The event 'the first heads occurs after the first tails.'

\edXabox{type="multichoice" expect="3" options="0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8"}


\end{edXproblem}

%\problem4 Now we'll do our first random simulation. Don't worry if you
%don't fully understand the commands. We will explain them in 
%the first tutorial. 
%
%In order to simulate counting the number of heads in 1000 tosses of  a fair coin give the following sequence of commands (hit return after each one).
%
%(In the first command the semicolon at the end 
%will keep a long list of numbers from being
%written to the screen. If you leave it off, you'll need to use the space bar to
%page through all the numbers.)\\
%\mlcmdna{x = binornd(1,.5, 1000,1);}
%\mlcmdna{total = sum(x)}
%
%You can use the up arrow to go back and run the commands again. You should get
%a different total.
%
%Give the value of the total number of heads for one of your simulations.
%\edXabox{expect="500" type="numerical" tolerance='60'}
