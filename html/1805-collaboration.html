<h2>Collaboration</h2>

MIT has a culture of teamwork. We encourage you to work with study partners.
<ul>
  <li>Collaboration on homework is encouraged.
  <li>You must write your solutions yourself, in your own words.</li>
  <li>You must list all collaborators and outside sources of information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Clicker Abuse</h2>
We do not anticipate having this come up, but, sadly,  
we have been made aware that there are cases where some students
use a clicker for an absent student. It should go without saying that this is a major violation of academic integrity. 
 If we become aware of it happening there will be serious consequences, including the loss of all clicker points for both parties.
