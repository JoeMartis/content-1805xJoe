<h2>Broad Course Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Learn the language and core concepts of probability theory.</li>
  <li> Understand basic principles of statistical inference (both Bayesian and frequentist).</li>
  <li> Build a starter statistical toolbox with appreciation for both the utility and limitations of these techniques.</li>
  <li> Use software and simulation to do statistics (Matlab).</li>
  <li> Become an informed consumer of statistical information.</li>
  <li> Prepare for further coursework or on-the-job study.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Arc</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Probability:
  (uncertain world, perfect knowledge of the uncertainty)</li>
  <ul>
    <li> Counting, independence, Bayes theorem, random variables, central limit theorem</li>
  </ul>
  <li> Statistics I: pure applied probability: 
(data in an uncertain world, perfect knowledge of the uncertainty)</li>
  <ul>
    <li> Bayesian inference with known priors
  </ul>
  <li> Statistics II: applied probability: 
(data in an uncertain world, imperfect knowledge of the uncertainty)</li>
  <ul>
    <li> Bayesian inference with unknown priors</li>
    <li> Frequentist confidence intervals and significance tests</li>
    <li> Resampling methods: bootstrapping</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

  Computation, simulation and visualization using Matlab and applets will be used throughout the course.

<h2>Specific Learning Objectives</h2>

<h3>Probability</h3>
Students completing the course will
<ol>
  <li> be able to use basic counting techniques (multiplication rule, combinations, permutations) to compute probability and odds</li>
  <li> be able to use Matlab to run basic simulations of probabilistic scenarios</li>
  <li> be able to compute conditional probabilities directly and using Bayes theorem, and check for independence of events</li>
  <li> be able set up and work with discrete random variables. In particular, understand the Bernoulli, binomial, geometric and Poisson distributions</li>
  <li> be able to work with continuous randam variables. In particular,
know the properties of uniform, normal and exponential distributions</li>
  <li> know what expectation and variance mean and be able to compute them</li>
  <li> understand the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem</li>
  <li> be able compute the covariance and correlation between
jointly distributed variables</li>
  <li> be able to use available resources (the internet or books) to learn 
about and use other distributions as they arise</li>
</ol>

<h3>Statistics</h3>
Students completing the course will
<ol>
  <li> be able to create and interpret scatter plots and histograms</li>
  <li> be able to compute and interpret simple linear regression between two variables</li>
  <li> understand the difference between probability and likelihood functions and be able to find the maximum likelihood estimate for a model parameter</li>
  <li> be able to do Bayesian updating with discrete priors to
compute posterior distributions and posterior odds</li>
  <li> be able to do Bayesian updating with continuous priors</li>
  <li> be able to construct estimates and predictions using the posterior distribution
  <li> be able to find credible intervals for parameter estimates</li>
  <li> be able to find confidence intervals for parameter estimates</li>
  <li> be able to use bootstrapping to estimate confidence intervals</li>
  <li> be able to use null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) to test the significance
of results, understand and be able to compute the p-value for these tests
  <li> be able to use specicific significance tests including, z-test t-test (one and two sample), chi-squared test</li>
